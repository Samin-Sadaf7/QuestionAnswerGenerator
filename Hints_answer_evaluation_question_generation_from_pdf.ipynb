            "end of clavicle rises higher than the manubrium, hence it poorly fits into its shallow socket. But a strong thick articular disc of fibrocartilage attached superiorly to the clavicle and 1st costal cartilage inferiorly prevents the displacement of the medial end of the clavicle.The articular surface of clavicle is convex from above downwards and slightly concave from front to back. The articular surface of sternum is reciprocally curved. The articular surfaces are covered with fibrocartilage.Articular CapsuleThe joint capsule is attached to the margins of the articular surfaces including the periphery of the articular disc. The synovial membrane lines the internal surface of the fibrous joint capsule, extending to the edges of the articular disc.Ligaments1. Anterior and posterior sternoclavicular ligaments:They reinforce the joint capsule anteriorly and posteriorly. The posterior ligament is weaker than the anterior ligament.2.

In between, it is attached to the superior border of the suprasternal notch.3. Costoclavicular ligament: It anchors the inferior surface of the sternal end of clavicle to the first rib and adjoining part of its cartilage.MovementsThe sternoclavicular joint allows the movements of pectoral girdle. This joint is critical to the movement of the clavicle.• Dislocation of the sternoclavicular joint: It is rare because the sternoclavicular (SC) joint is extremely strong. However, dislocation of this joint in people below 25 years of age may result from fractures through the epiphyseal plate because epiphysis at the sternal end of clavicle does not unite until 23–25 years of age. The medial end is usually dislocated anteriorly. Backward dislocation is prevented by the costoclavicu-lar ligament.• Transmission of weight of the upper limb: The weight of the upper limb is transmitted from scapula to the clavicle through coracoclavicular ligament, and then from clavicle to sternum through sternoclavicular joint. Some of the weight is transmitted to the first rib through costoclavicular ligament (Fig. 1.4). When a person falls on the outstretched hand the force of blow is usually transmitted along the length of the clavicle, i.e., along its long axis. The clavicle may fracture at the junction of its middle and lateral third but it is rare for the SC joint to dislocate.• Dislocation of the acromioclavicular joint: It may occur following a severe blow on the superolateral part of the shoulder. In severe form, both acromioclavicular and coracoclavicular ligaments are torn. Consequently the shoulder separates from the clavicle and falls because of the weight of the limb. The acromioclavicular joint dislocation is often termed shoulder separation.Clinical correlation\n",

It presents the following clinical features:• Numbness, tingling, and pain along the medial side of forearm and hand, and wasting of small muscles of the hand due to the involvement of lower trunk of brachial plexus (T1).• There may be ischemic symptoms in the upper limb such as pallor and coldness of the upper limb, and weak radial pulse due to compression of the subclavian artery.Clinical correlationINFERIOR THORACIC APERTURE(THORACIC OUTLET)The inferior thoracic aperture is broad and surrounds the upper part of the abdominal cavity.

Laxity of joint capsule.2. Articulation between relatively large humeral head and smaller and shallow glenoid cavity.The glenohumeral joint permits four groups of movements:1.

Its broad end is directed upwards and lower pointed end is directed downwards.FEATURES AND ATTACHMENTSManubrium (Episternum; Figs. 15.1 and 15.2)It is roughly quadrilateral in shape. It lies opposite to the third and fourth thoracic vertebrae. It is the thickest and strongest part of the sternum and presents the following features:1. Two surfaces—anterior and posterior.2. Four borders—superior, inferior, and lateral (right and left).Anterior surface o n  e a c h  s i d e  p r o v i d e s  a t t a c h m e n t  t o  t h e  sternal head of sternocleidomastoid and pectoralis major muscles.Posterior surface is smooth and forms anterior boundary of superior mediastinum. /circle6On each side, it provides attachment to two muscles:(a) sternohyoid at the level of clavicular notch, and(b) sternothyroid a t  t h e  l e v e l  o f  f a c e t  f o r  1 s t  c o s t a l  cartilage. /circle6Lower half is related to arch of aorta. /circle6Upper half is related to three branches of the arch of aorta, viz. brachiocephalic artery, left common carotid artery, left subclavian artery, and left brachiocephalic vein.Upper border is thick,  r ounded,  and c onca v e.  I t pr esents a notch called suprasternal notch or jugular notch. /circle6It provides attachment to the interclavicular ligament. /circle6Clavicular notch on either side of suprasternal notch articulates with the clavicle to form sternoclavicular joint.Lateral border presents two articular facets: /circle6Upper facet articulates with the 1st costal cartilage to form primary cartilaginous joint. /circle6Lower demifacet along with other demifacet in the body of sternum articulates with the 2nd costal cartilage.Lower border articulates with the upper end of the body of sternum to form secondary cartilaginous joint called manubriosternal joint. The manubrium makes a slight angle with the body at this junction called sternal angle or angle of Louis. It is recognized by the presence of a transverse ridge on the anterior aspect of the sternum.Body (Mesosternum; Figs 15.1 and 15.2)The features of the body are as follows:1.

            "• Rotator cuff disorders: The rotator cuff disorders include calcific supraspinatus tendinitis, subacromial the rotator cuff represent overall the most common cause of shoulder pain. The rotator cuff is commonly injured during repetitive use of the upper limb above the horizontal level (e.g., in throwing sports, swimming, and weight lifting). The deposition of calcium in the supraspinatus tendon is common. The calcium deposition irritates the overlying subacromial bursa causing subacromial bursitis. Consequently, when the arm is abducted the inflamed bursa is caught between tendon and acromion impingement, which causes severe pain. In most people, pain occurs during 60°–120° of abduction (painful arc syndrome). The rotator cuff disorders usually occur in males after 50 years of age.The pain due to subacromial bursitis is elicited when the deltoid is pressed just below the acromion, when the arm is adducted. The pain cannot be elicited by the pressure on the same point when the arm is abducted because the bursa slips/disappears under the acromion process (Dawbarn’s sign).ACROMIOCLAVICULAR JOINT (Fig. 6.12)TypeIt is a plane type of the synovial joint between the lateral end of the clavicle and acromion process of the scapula. The acromioclavicular joint is located about 2.5 cm medial to the point of the shoulder.Articular SurfacesThese are small facets present on the lateral end of clavicle and the medial margin of the acromion process of the scapula. The articular surfaces are covered with fibrocartilage. The joint cavity is subdivided by an incomplete wedge-shaped articular disc.Joint CapsuleIt is thin, lax fibrous sac attached to the margins of articular surfaces.LigamentsThese are acromioclavicular and coracoclavicular ligaments.1. Acromioclavicular ligament: It is a fibrous band that extends from acromion to the clavicle. It strengthens the acromioclavicular joint superiorly.2. Coracoclavicular ligament: It lies a little away from the joint itself but play an important role in maintaining the integrity of the joint.The coracoclavicular ligament consists of two parts: (a) conoid and (b) trapezoid, which are united posteri-orly and often separated by a bursa. /circle6The conoid ligament i s  a n  i n v e r t e d  c o n e - s h a p e d  fibrous band. The apex is attached to the root of the coracoid process just lateral to the scapular notch and base is attached to the conoid tubercle on the inferior surface of the clavicle. /circle6The trapezoid ligament i s  a  h o r i z o n t a l  f i b r o u s  b a n d  that stretches from upper surface of the coracoid process to the trapezoid line on the inferior surface of lateral end of the clavicle.N.B. The coracoclavicular ligament is largely responsible for suspending the weight of the scapula and upper limb from clavicle.The coracoclavicular ligament is the strongest ligament of the upper limb.MovementsThe acromioclavicular joint permits the rotation of acromion of scapula at the acromial end of the clavicle. These movements are associated with movements of scapula at the scapulothoracic joint/linkage.STERNOCLAVICULAR JOINT (Fig. 6.12)TypeThe sternoclavicular joint is a saddle type of the synovial joint.Articular SurfacesThe rounded sternal end of clavicle articulates with the shallow socket at the superolateral angle of the manubrium sterni and adjacent part of the 1st costal cartilage.

            "Type your answer: The costoclavicular ligament, also known as the rhomboid ligament, plays a significant role in stabilizing the sternoclavicular joint by anchoring the clavicle to the first rib. Its clinical significance includes the following points:  Stability of the Sternoclavicular Joint: The ligament provides crucial stability to the sternoclavicular joint, preventing excessive movement and dislocation. This joint is essential for the wide range of motion of the shoulder.  Costoclavicular Syndrome: This ligament can be involved in a condition called costoclavicular syndrome, a form of thoracic outlet syndrome. This occurs when the space between the clavicle and the first rib is narrowed, leading to compression of the subclavian vessels and brachial plexus. Symptoms may include pain, numbness, and weakness in the upper limb.  Guidance in Surgery: Understanding the anatomy and attachments of the costoclavicular ligament is important for surgeons performing procedures around the clavicle and first rib, as well as for interventions involving the sternoclavicular joint. Misidentification or damage to the ligament during surgery can compromise joint stability and function.  Imaging and Diagnosis: In cases of trauma or dislocation of the sternoclavicular joint, the integrity of the costoclavicular ligament is often assessed through imaging techniques such as MRI or CT scans to determine the extent of injury and guide appropriate treatment.  Overall, the costoclavicular ligament is vital for maintaining the functional integrity of the sternoclavicular joint and plays a key role in conditions that affect the shoulder girdle.\n",

They mainly supply blood to the hand through superficial and deep palmar arterial arches.The blood supply to the forearm is mainly derived from the anterior and posterior interosseous arteries, the terminal branches of the common interosseous artery, a branch of the ulnar artery.Ulnar ArteryCourseThe ulnar artery is the larger terminal branch of the brachial artery. It begins in the cubital fossa at the level of the neck of the radius (or 1 cm distal to the flexion crease of the elbow). It runs downwards and reaches the medial side of the forearm midway between the elbow and wrist. In the upper one-third of forearm, the course is oblique (i.e., downwards and medially) but in lower two-third it is vertical.The median nerve lies medial to the artery 2.5 cm distal to the elbow and then crosses the artery.The ulnar nerve lies medial to the distal two-third of the artery.It enters the palm by passing in front of flexor retinaculum lateral to the ulnar nerve and the pisiform bone. It terminates in the hand by dividing into large superficial and small deep branches. The superficial branch—the continuation of the artery superficial palmar arch, which anastomosis with superficial palmar branch of the radial artery.RelationsIn the upper part of its course, it lies deep to superficial flexor muscles. In the lower part of its course, it becomes superficial and lies between the tendons of flexor carpi Fig. 9.9 Origin and insertion of the pronator quadratus.OriginOblique ridge onlower 1/4th ofanterior surface of ulnaInsertionLower 1/4th ofanterior surfaceof radius PRONATORQUADRATUS\n",

            "VEINS OF THE UPPER LIMBThe deep veins of the upper limb follow the arteries and run superiorly towards the axilla, where axillary vein travels superiorly and becomes subclavian vein at the outer border of the 1st rib. The subclavian vein continues towards the root of the neck where it joins the internal jugular vein to form the brachiocephalic vein. The two brachiocephalic veins (right and left) join each other to form superior vena cava, which drains into the heart.The superficial veins of the upper limb originate from the dorsal venous arch of the hand. The lateral end of the dorsal venous arch forms the cephalic vein, which runs along the lateral aspect of the upper limb and terminates into the axillary vein in the axilla. The medial end of the dorsal venous arch forms the basilic vein, which ascends along the medial aspect of the upper limb and empties into the axillary vein as well. Anterior to the elbow, the cephalic vein is connected to the basilic vein via the median cubital vein.LYMPHATICS OF THE UPPER LIMBThe lymphatics of the upper limb originate in the hand. The superficial lymph vessels follow the superficial veins. The deep lymph vessels follow the deep arteries (viz. radial, ulnar, and brachial) and pass superiorly to the axilla where they drain into the axillary lymph nodes.Fig. 1.6 Arteries of the upper limb.\n",

Anterior and posterior ulnar collateral (recurrent) arteries, which take part in the arterial anastomosis around the elbow joint.3. Common interosseous artery, which arises from the upper part of the ulnar artery and after a very short course at the upper border of interosseous membrane, it divides into anterior and posterior interosseous arteries. 4. Anterior and posterior ulnar carpal branches, w h i c h  take part in the formation of anterior and posterior carpal arches.5. Terminal branches are two, the larger superficial branch continues as the superficial palmar arch, while the smaller deep branch joins the deep palmar arch.Aberrant ulnar artery: In about 3% of individuals, the ulnar artery may arise high in the arm and passes superficial to the flexor muscles of the forearm and is termed super/f_i  cial ulnar artery. This variation should always be kept in mind while withdrawing blood samples or giving intravenous injections, because if superficial ulnar artery is mistaken for a vein it may be damaged and produce bleeding. Further, if an irritating drug is injected into the aberrant artery, the result could be fatal.Clinical correlation\n",
            "Anterior Interosseous Artery (Fig. 9.21)It along with the posterior interosseous artery is the main source of blood supply to the forearm. It is also the deepest artery on the front of the forearm.The anterior interosseous artery descends on the front of interosseous membrane in company with the anterior interosseous nerve (a branch of the median nerve). It pierces the membrane at the upper border of pronator quadratus to enter the posterior compartment of the forearm (cf. peroneal artery of the leg), where it anastomoses with the posterior interosseous artery and travels underneath the extensor retinaculum to reach the dorsal aspect of the wrist to join the dorsal carpal arch. The posterior interosseous artery is usually smaller than the anterior. It passes posteriorly between the oblique cord and proximal border of the interosseous membrane. It accompanies the posterior interosseous nerve (deep branch of the radial nerve). It gives rise to the interosseous recurrent artery, which takes part in the arterial anastomosis around the elbow joint.Radial ArteryOrigin and CourseThe radial artery is the smaller terminal branch of the brachial artery. It begins in cubital fossa at the level of the neck of radius. It passes downwards to the wrist with lateral convexity. In the upper part, it lies beneath the brachioradialis on the deep muscles of the forearm. In the distal part of the forearm, it lies on the anterior surface of the radius and is covered only by the skin and fascia. The superficial radial nerve lies lateral to the middle one-third of the radial artery. The radial artery leaves the forearm by winding around the lateral aspect of the wrist to reach the anatomical snuff-box on the posterior surface of the hand. Its further course is described in the hand.RelationsAnterior:  The upper part of the radial artery is overlapped by brachioradialis, while its lower part is covered only by the skin, and superficial and deep fasciae.Posterior:  The radial artery from above to downward lies on the following structures:(a) Biceps tendon.

The axillary artery is divided into three parts based on its position relative to the pectoralis minor muscle:  First part: Located between the lateral border of the first rib and the medial border of the pectoralis minor. Second part: Lies posterior to the pectoralis minor. Third part: Extends from the lateral border of the pectoralis minor to the lower border of the teres major. Throughout its course, the axillary artery gives off several branches that supply the shoulder region and parts of the thoracic wall.

It provides an area for the attachment of muscles.PECULIARITIESThe peculiar features of the clavicle are as follows:1. It is the only long bone which lies horizontally.2. It has no medullary cavity.3. It is subcutaneous throughout its extent.4. It is the first bone to start ossifying (between the fifth and sixth week of intrauterine life) and last bone to complete its ossification (at 25 years).5. It is the only long bone which ossifies by two primary centers.6. It is the only long bone which ossifies in membrane except for its medial end (cf. long bones ossify in cartilage).7. It may be pierced through and through by cutaneous nerve (intermediate supraclavicular nerve).PARTSThe clavicle consists of three parts: two ends (medial and lateral) and a shaft (Fig. 2.2):Ends1. The lateral (acromial) end is flattened above downwards and articulates with medial margin of the acromion process.2. The medial (sternal) end is enlarged and quadrilateral. It articulates with the clavicular notch of the manubrium sterni.ShaftThe shaft is curved. Its medial two-third is round and convex forwards, and its lateral one-third is flattened and concave forwards. The inferior surface of the shaft possesses a small longitudinal groove in its middle third.ANATOMICAL POSITION AND SIDE DETERMINATIONThe side of clavicle can be determined by holding the bone horizontally in such a way that its flattened end is on the lateral side and its enlarged quadrilateral end is on the medial side. The convexity of its medial two-third and concavity of its lateral one-third face forwards with longitudinal groove in the middle third of shaft facing inferiorly.FEATURES AND ATTACHMENTS (Fig. 2.3)Lateral End/Acromial EndIt is flattened above downwards. An oval facet on this end articulates with the facet on the medial margin of the acromion to form acromioclavicular joint. The lateral end provides attachment to fibrous capsule of acromioclavicular joint.Medial End/Sternal EndThe enlarged medial end has a saddle-shaped articular surface, which articulates with the clavicular notch of manubrium sterni to form sternoclavicular joint. It provides attachment to (a) fibrous capsule (b) articular disc, and (c) interclavicular ligament.\n",

            "end of clavicle rises higher than the manubrium, hence it poorly fits into its shallow socket. But a strong thick articular disc of fibrocartilage attached superiorly to the clavicle and 1st costal cartilage inferiorly prevents the displacement of the medial end of the clavicle.The articular surface of clavicle is convex from above downwards and slightly concave from front to back. The articular surface of sternum is reciprocally curved. The articular surfaces are covered with fibrocartilage.Articular CapsuleThe joint capsule is attached to the margins of the articular surfaces including the periphery of the articular disc. The synovial membrane lines the internal surface of the fibrous joint capsule, extending to the edges of the articular disc.Ligaments1. Anterior and posterior sternoclavicular ligaments:They reinforce the joint capsule anteriorly and posteriorly. The posterior ligament is weaker than the anterior ligament.2.

In between, it is attached to the superior border of the suprasternal notch.3. Costoclavicular ligament: It anchors the inferior surface of the sternal end of clavicle to the first rib and adjoining part of its cartilage.MovementsThe sternoclavicular joint allows the movements of pectoral girdle. This joint is critical to the movement of the clavicle.• Dislocation of the sternoclavicular joint: It is rare because the sternoclavicular (SC) joint is extremely strong. However, dislocation of this joint in people below 25 years of age may result from fractures through the epiphyseal plate because epiphysis at the sternal end of clavicle does not unite until 23–25 years of age. The medial end is usually dislocated anteriorly. Backward dislocation is prevented by the costoclavicu-lar ligament.• Transmission of weight of the upper limb: The weight of the upper limb is transmitted from scapula to the clavicle through coracoclavicular ligament, and then from clavicle to sternum through sternoclavicular joint. Some of the weight is transmitted to the first rib through costoclavicular ligament (Fig. 1.4). When a person falls on the outstretched hand the force of blow is usually transmitted along the length of the clavicle, i.e., along its long axis. The clavicle may fracture at the junction of its middle and lateral third but it is rare for the SC joint to dislocate.• Dislocation of the acromioclavicular joint: It may occur following a severe blow on the superolateral part of the shoulder. In severe form, both acromioclavicular and coracoclavicular ligaments are torn. Consequently the shoulder separates from the clavicle and falls because of the weight of the limb. The acromioclavicular joint dislocation is often termed shoulder separation.Clinical correlation\n",

            "OSSIFICATION (Fig. 2.5)The ossification of clavicle is membranocartilaginous. Whole of it ossifies in the membrane except its medial end which ossifies in the cartilage. The clavicle begins to ossify before any other bone in the body. It ossifies by four ossification centres – two primary centres for shaft and two secondary centres, one for each end.The site of appearance, time of appearance, and time of fusion of various centres is given in the Table 2.2.N.B. Growing end of clavicle: The sternal end of clavicle is its growing end, because epiphysis at this end appears at the age of 19–20 years and unites with the shaft at the age of 25 years. It is the last of all the epiphyses in the body to fuse with the shaft. The radiological appearance of this epiphysis in females confirms their bone age for legal consent to marriage.Congenital anomalies:• Clavicular dysostosis: It is a clinical condition in which medial and lateral parts of clavicle remain separate due to nonunion of two primary centers of ossification.• Cleidocranial dysostosis: It is a clinical condition characterized by partial or complete absence of clavicle associated with defective ossification of the skull bones.Clinical correlationFracture of clavicle (Fig. 2.4): The clavicle is the most commonly fractured bone in the body. It commonly fractures at the junction of its lateral one-third and medial two-third due to blows to the shoulder or indirect forces, usually as a result of strong impact on the hand or shoulder, when person falls on the outstretched hand or the shoulder. When fracture occurs, the lateral fragment is displaced downward by the weight of the upper limb because trapezius alone is unable to support the weight of the upper limb. In addition, the lateral fragment is drawn medially by shoulder adductors viz. teres major, etc. The medial fragment is slightly elevated by the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The characteristic clinical picture of the patient with fractured clavicle is that of a man/woman supporting his sagging upper limb with the opposite hand. The fracture at the junction of lateral one-third and medial two-third occurs because: (a) This is the weakest site.(b) Two curvatures of clavicle meet at this site.(c) The transmission of forces (due to impact) from the clavicle to scapula occur at this site through coracoclavicular ligament.Clinical correlation\n",
            "N.B. • The clavicle is absent in animals in which the upper limbs are used only for walking and weight transmission, and not for grasping such as horse, etc.• One of the two primary centers of clavicle is regarded as precoracoid element of reptilian shoulder girdle.\n",

Therefore, a sound understanding of its structure and functions is of great clinical significance—the ultimate aim of treating any ailment of the upper limb being to restore its function.The upper limbs are connected to the trunk by a pectoral girdle. The limb girdle is defined as the bones which connect the limbs to the axial skeleton. The p e c t o r a l  g i r d l e  is composed of two bones – scapula and clavicle. The scapula is connected to the clavicle by the acromioclavicular joint, and the clavicle is attached to the axial skeleton by the sternoclavicular joint. The pectoral girdle is not a complete girdle because it is attached to the axial skeleton only anteriorly. The primary function of the pectoral girdle is to provide attachment to numerous muscles, which move the arm and forearm. It is not weight bearing and is, therefore, more delicate as compared to the pelvic girdle. Note that pelvic girdle is a complete girdle.N.B. Only one small joint (sternoclavicular joint) connects the skeleton of upper limb to the rest of the skeleton of the body.PARTS OF THE UPPER LIMBFor descriptive purposes, the upper limb is divided into the following four parts (Fig. 1.2):1. Shoulder.2. Arm or brachium.3. Forearm or antebrachium.4. Hand.The shoulder region includes: (a) axilla or armpit, (b) scapular region or parts around the scapula (shoulder blade), and (c) pectoral or breast region on the front of the chest.The bones of the shoulder region are the clavicle (collar bone) and the scapula (shoulder blade). They articulate with each other at the acromioclavicular joint and form the shoulder girdle. The shoulder girdle articulates with the rest of the skeleton of the body only at the small sternoclavicular joint.The arm is the part of the upper limb between the shoulder and elbow (or cubitus). The bone of the arm is humerus, which articulates with the scapula at the shoulder joint and upper ends of radius and ulna at the elbow joint.The forearm is the part of the upper limb between the elbow and the wrist. The bones of the forearm are radius and ulna. These bones articulate with humerus at the elbow joint and with each other forming radio-ulnar joints.The hand (or manus) consists of the following parts: (a) wrist or carpus, (b) hand proper (or metacarpus), and (c) digits (thumb and fingers).The wrist consists of eight carpal bones arranged in two rows, each consisting of four bones. The carpal bones articulate (a) with each other at intercarpal joints, (b) proximally with radius forming radio-carpal wrist joint, and (c) distally with metacarpal bones at carpometacarpal joints.ClavicleShoulderScapula\n",

The thick upper part of the fascia extending from first rib near costochondral junction to the coracoid process is called costocoracoid ligament.N.B. The clavipectoral fascia encloses two muscles—subclavius and pectoralis minor.Structures Piercing the Clavipectoral FasciaThese are as follows (Fig. 3.11):1. Lateral pectoral nerve.2. Thoraco-acromial artery.3. Lymphatics from the breast to the apical group of axillary group of lymph nodes.4. Cephalic vein. The first two structures pass outwards, whereas the lower two structures pass inwards.BREAST (MAMMARY GLAND)The mammary gland is a modified sweat gland present in the superficial fascia of the pectoral region. The mammary gland is found in both sexes. However, it remains rudimentary in male but becomes well-developed in female at puberty. On rare occasions the breasts of male become enlarged, this condition is called gynecomastia. I n  f e m a l e ,  i t  f o r m s  a n  accessory sex organ of female reproductive system and provides milk to the newborn baby. The anatomy of breast is of great surgical importance, and therefore, needs to be studied in detail.LOCATION (Figs 3.12 and 3.13)The breast is located in the superficial fascia of the pectoral region. A small extension from its superolateral part (axillary tail of Spence) however pierces the deep fascia and extends into the axilla. The aperture in the deep fascia through which axillary tail passes into the axilla is called foramen of Langer. The axillary tail is the site of high percentage of breast tumor.SHAPE AND EXTENT (Figs 3.12 and 3.13)ShapeHemispherical bulge.Extent1. Ve r t i c a l l y, it extends from 2nd rib to 6th rib.2.

            "\n",
            "1. **It is the only long bone which lies horizontally:** This position makes it susceptible to fracture, especially during falls onto the outstretched hand. \n",
            "2. **It has no medullary cavity:** This feature makes it more prone to fracture as it lacks the internal support provided by a medullary cavity.\n",
            "3. **It is subcutaneous throughout its extent:**  This makes it palpable and easily accessible for clinical examination. It also makes it prone to injury and infection.\n",
            "4. **It is the first bone to start ossifying (between the fifth and sixth week of intrauterine life) and last bone to complete its ossification (at 25 years):** This makes it a useful indicator of skeletal maturity. It also makes it prone to injury in young individuals as the epiphyseal plate is still open.\n",
            "5. **It is the only long bone which ossifies by two primary centers:** This is a key feature in understanding its developmental anatomy and potential for congenital anomalies.\n",
            "6. **It is the only long bone which ossifies in membrane except for its medial end (cf. long bones ossify in cartilage):** This makes it less prone to certain types of bone diseases and disorders that primarily affect cartilage.\n",
            "7. **It may be pierced through and through by cutaneous nerve (intermediate supraclavicular nerve):** This explains why pain may be felt along the clavicle in cases of nerve damage, and why it can be a site for nerve entrapment. \n",
