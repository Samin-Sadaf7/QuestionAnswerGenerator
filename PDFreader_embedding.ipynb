Posterior cutaneous nerve of the thigh  runs downward in \\nthe midline on the back of thigh deep to fascia lata and \\nsuperficially to the long head of biceps femoris. On \\nreaching the popliteal fossa, it pierces the fascial roof of the fossa and accompanies the short saphenous vein \\ndown to the middle of the calf. Its branches supply the \\nskin on the back of thigh and proximal part of the back \\nof leg. \\n2. Cutaneous branches of the obturator nerve  supply the \\nmedial part of the back of thigh in the upper part.\\n3. Medial branches of the anterior cutaneous nerve of the \\nthigh supply the medial part of the back of thigh in the \\nlower part.\\n4. Lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh  sends twigs to the \\nposterior aspect of thigh in the upper part.\\nCONTENTS OF POSTERIOR COMPARTMENT OF \\nTHE THIGH\\nThe posterior compartment of the thigh is also called flexor \\ncompartment. It is completely separated from the anterior \\ncompartment by the lateral intermuscular septum, but it is \\nincompletely separated from the medial compartment of \\nthigh by the ill-defined posterior intermuscular septum.\\nThe contents of posterior compartment of the thigh are as \\nfollows:\\n /circle6Muscles: Hamstring muscles and short head of the biceps \\nfemoris.\\n/circle6 Nerve:  Sciatic nerve.\\n/circle6 Arteries:  Arterial anastomoses on the back of the thigh.\\nMUSCLES ON THE BACK OF THE THIGH\\nThese muscles on the back of the thigh are called the \\nhamstring muscles  (Latin ham /H11005 back of thigh). However \\nconventionally the short head of the biceps femoris is not \\nincluded in the hamstring group.\\nThe hamstring muscles are:\\n1. Semitendinosus.\\n2. Semimembranosus.\\n3.

Appendix of epididymis (hydatid of Morgagni):  It is a \\nsmall pedunculated rounded body attached to the head \\nof epididymis. It is remnant of cranial end of \\nmesonephric (Wolffian) duct.\\n3. Paradidymis (organ of Giraldes):  It consists of 3 or 4 \\nsmall free tubules which are found in the spermatic cord, \\njust above the head of epididymis. They are remnants of \\ncaudal mesonephric tubules.\\n4. Superior aberrant ductules:  They are 2 or 3 in number \\nand attached to the upper end of testis above the afferent \\nductules of testis. They are remnants of the upper \\nmesonephric tubules.\\n5. Inferior aberrant ductules:  They are 1 or 2 in number and \\nattached to the tail of epididymis. They are remnants of \\nthe intermediate mesonephric tubules.\\nN.B. The embryological remnants (vide supra) may \\nsometime form cysts in relation to the testis and epididymis.\\nDESCENT OF THE TESTIS (Fig. 5.21)\\nThe testis develops in the abdominal cavity where the \\ntemperature is high and not suitable for proper \\nspermatogenesis. Hence, it migrates out of the abdominal \\ncavity into the scrotum.\\nAt an early stage of intrauterine life, the developing testis \\nlies in the upper abdomen on the medial side of the \\nmesonephros. A fold of the peritoneum called processus \\nvaginalis extends in front of the testis and reaches the \\nscrotum. Just after the formation of processus vaginalis, a \\ncord-like fibromuscular band, the gubernaculum testis, \\ndevelops and connects the mesonephric duct, and the lower \\npole of the testis to the base of the scrotum. Differential body \\ngrowth in the embryo and fetus results in the descent of the \\ntestis from the abdominal cavity to the scrotum.\\nEach testis begins to descend during the 2nd month of the \\nintrauterine life (IUL).\\n /circle6It reaches the iliac fossa by the 3rd month of IUL.\\n /circle6It rests at the deep inguinal ring from 4th to 6th month of \\nIUL.\\n /circle6It traverses the inguinal canal during the 7th month and \\nreaches the superficial inguinal ring by the 8th month of \\nIUL.\\n /circle6It enters the scrotum at the 9th month of IUL.\\n /circle6It reaches the base of the scrotum at or just after birth.\\nFactors Responsible for Descent of the Testis\\nThese factors are as follows:\\n1. Differential growth of the body wall.\\n2. Increased intra-abdominal pressure and temperature.\\n3. Hormones (male sex hormones produced by the testis, \\nand maternal gonadotrophins).Fig. 5.21 Descent of the testis (stages A, B, C, and D in \\nsequence) note the fate of processus vaginalis.\\nDDuctus\\ndeferens\\nBase of\\nscrotumGubernaculum\\ntestisTunica vaginalisRemains of\\nprocessus\\nvaginalis\\nTestis\\nMesonephric\\nduct\\nGubernaculum\\ntestis\\nBase of\\nfuture scrotumPeritoneum\\nA\\nBProcessus\\nvaginalis\\nCDuctus \\ndeferens\\n4.

It is the largest ball and socket type of joint \\nin the body. Its main functions are: (a) to support the body \\nweight during standing and (b) to transmit the forces \\ngenerated by movements of trunk femur during walking. It \\nis multiaxial and permits same movements as shoulder joint \\nin the upper limb because the long and narrow neck of femur \\nacts as strut and makes an angle with the shaft (neck\\u2013shaft \\nangle). However, its range of movements is restricted due to \\nits role in weight bearing.\\nTYPE\\nSynovial joint of ball and socket varietyARTICULAR SURFACES\\nThe head of the femur articulates with the horse-shoe-\\nshaped acetabulum of the hip bone to form the hip joint. \\n(Fig. 26.2):\\n1. The head of femur  forms more than half of a sphere. It \\nis covered by the articular hyaline cartilage except for a \\nsmall pit\\u2014the fovea capitis for ligamentum teres.\\n2. The acetabulum (Latin acetabulum /H11005 vinegar cup) \\npresents three features: a horseshoe-shaped lunate \\nsurface, acetabular notch, and acetabular fossa. Out of \\nthese, only lunate surface is articular and covered by an \\narticular cartilage. The depth of the acetabulum is \\nincreased by the acetabular labrum.\\nFig. 26.1 Hip joint: A, line diagram of the right hip joint; B, radiograph of the right hip joint.Acetabulum of\\nhip boneHead

Posterior cutaneous nerve of the thigh  runs downward in \\nthe midline on the back of thigh deep to fascia lata and \\nsuperficially to the long head of biceps femoris. On \\nreaching the popliteal fossa, it pierces the fascial roof of the fossa and accompanies the short saphenous vein \\ndown to the middle of the calf. Its branches supply the \\nskin on the back of thigh and proximal part of the back \\nof leg. \\n2. Cutaneous branches of the obturator nerve  supply the \\nmedial part of the back of thigh in the upper part.\\n3.

Lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh  sends twigs to the \\nposterior aspect of thigh in the upper part.\\nCONTENTS OF POSTERIOR COMPARTMENT OF \\nTHE THIGH\\nThe posterior compartment of the thigh is also called flexor \\ncompartment. It is completely separated from the anterior \\ncompartment by the lateral intermuscular septum, but it is \\nincompletely separated from the medial compartment of \\nthigh by the ill-defined posterior intermuscular septum.\\nThe contents of posterior compartment of the thigh are as \\nfollows:\\n /circle6Muscles: Hamstring muscles and short head of the biceps \\nfemoris.\\n/circle6 Nerve:  Sciatic nerve.\\n/circle6 Arteries:  Arterial anastomoses on the back of the thigh.\\nMUSCLES ON THE BACK OF THE THIGH\\nThese muscles on the back of the thigh are called the \\nhamstring muscles  (Latin ham /H11005 back of thigh). However \\nconventionally the short head of the biceps femoris is not \\nincluded in the hamstring group.\\nThe hamstring muscles are:\\n1. Semitendinosus.\\n2. Semimembranosus.\\n3.

Paradidymis (organ of Giraldes):  It consists of 3 or 4 \\nsmall free tubules which are found in the spermatic cord, \\njust above the head of epididymis. They are remnants of \\ncaudal mesonephric tubules.\\n4. Superior aberrant ductules:  They are 2 or 3 in number \\nand attached to the upper end of testis above the afferent \\nductules of testis.

They are remnants of \\nthe intermediate mesonephric tubules.\\nN.B. The embryological remnants (vide supra) may \\nsometime form cysts in relation to the testis and epididymis.\\nDESCENT OF THE TESTIS (Fig. 5.21)\\nThe testis develops in the abdominal cavity where the \\ntemperature is high and not suitable for proper \\nspermatogenesis. Hence, it migrates out of the abdominal \\ncavity into the scrotum.\\nAt an early stage of intrauterine life, the developing testis \\nlies in the upper abdomen on the medial side of the \\nmesonephros. A fold of the peritoneum called processus \\nvaginalis extends in front of the testis and reaches the \\nscrotum. Just after the formation of processus vaginalis, a \\ncord-like fibromuscular band, the gubernaculum testis, \\ndevelops and connects the mesonephric duct, and the lower \\npole of the testis to the base of the scrotum. Differential body \\ngrowth in the embryo and fetus results in the descent of the \\ntestis from the abdominal cavity to the scrotum.\\nEach testis begins to descend during the 2nd month of the \\nintrauterine life (IUL).\\n /circle6It reaches the iliac fossa by the 3rd month of IUL.\\n /circle6It rests at the deep inguinal ring from 4th to 6th month of \\nIUL.\\n /circle6It traverses the inguinal canal during the 7th month and \\nreaches the superficial inguinal ring by the 8th month of \\nIUL.\\n /circle6It enters the scrotum at the 9th month of IUL.\\n /circle6It reaches the base of the scrotum at or just after birth.\\nFactors Responsible for Descent of the Testis\\nThese factors are as follows:\\n1. Differential growth of the body wall.\\n2. Increased intra-abdominal pressure and temperature.\\n3. Hormones (male sex hormones produced by the testis, \\nand maternal gonadotrophins).Fig. 5.21 Descent of the testis (stages A, B, C, and D in \\nsequence) note the fate of processus vaginalis.\\nDDuctus\\ndeferens\\nBase of\\nscrotumGubernaculum\\ntestisTunica vaginalisRemains of\\nprocessus\\nvaginalis\\nTestis\\nMesonephric\\nduct\\nGubernaculum\\ntestis\\nBase of\\nfuture scrotumPeritoneum\\nA\\nBProcessus\\nvaginalis\\nCDuctus \\ndeferens\\n4.

It is the largest ball and socket type of joint \\nin the body. Its main functions are: (a) to support the body \\nweight during standing and (b) to transmit the forces \\ngenerated by movements of trunk femur during walking. It \\nis multiaxial and permits same movements as shoulder joint \\nin the upper limb because the long and narrow neck of femur \\nacts as strut and makes an angle with the shaft (neck\\u2013shaft \\nangle). However, its range of movements is restricted due to \\nits role in weight bearing.\\nTYPE\\nSynovial joint of ball and socket varietyARTICULAR SURFACES\\nThe head of the femur articulates with the horse-shoe-\\nshaped acetabulum of the hip bone to form the hip joint. \\n(Fig. 26.2):\\n1. The head of femur  forms more than half of a sphere. It \\nis covered by the articular hyaline cartilage except for a \\nsmall pit\\u2014the fovea capitis for ligamentum teres.\\n2. The acetabulum (Latin acetabulum /H11005 vinegar cup) \\npresents three features: a horseshoe-shaped lunate \\nsurface, acetabular notch, and acetabular fossa. Out of \\nthese, only lunate surface is articular and covered by an \\narticular cartilage. The depth of the acetabulum is \\nincreased by the acetabular labrum.\\nFig. 26.1 Hip joint: A, line diagram of the right hip joint; B, radiograph of the right hip joint.Acetabulum of\\nhip boneHead of femur\\nA B\\nHip bone\\nFemurHip bone\\nAcetabulum of\\nhip bone\\nHead of femur\\nFemur\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"/content/drive/MyDrive/All Prof Course/1st Prof/Anatomy/Text Book/vishram singh textbook of anatomy abdomen and lower limb.pdf\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"page\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 146,\n        \"min\": 4,\n        \"max\": 520,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 495,\n        \"samples\": [\n          481\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"embedding\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

            "were made to introduce rational methods into medicine, but none was successful owing to the\n",
            "dominance of systems of thought (“schools”) that purported to explain all of biology and disease\n",
            "without the need for experimentation and observation. These schools promulgated bizarre notions such\n",

            "17th century, reliance on observation  and experimentation began to replace theorizing in physiology\n",
            "and clinical medicine. As the value of these methods in the study of disease became clear,\n",
            "physicians in Great Britain and on the Continent began to apply them to the effects of traditional\n",
            "drugs used in their own practices. Thus, materia medica—the science of drug preparation and the\n",
            "medical uses of drugs—began to develop as the precursor to pharmacology. However, any real\n",

            "how drugs work at the organ and tissue levels. Paradoxically, real advances in basic pharmacology\n",
            "during this time were accompanied by an outburst of unscientific claims by manufacturers and\n",
            "marketers of worthless “patent medicines.” Not until the concepts of rational therapeutics,\n",
            "especially that of the controlled clinical trial,  were reintroduced into medicine—only  about 60\n",
