# RAG Implementations for Medical Education

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models aimed at enhancing medical education. These models generate study questions from both text and images, making them valuable tools for medical students.

## Features

- **Multimodal RAG**: Integrates text and image data to create comprehensive questions, aiding in subjects like radiology and pathology.
- **Modal RAG**: Utilizes text data to generate questions, suitable for text-heavy subjects such as medical literature and case studies.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of these models is to assist medical students in their studies by automatically generating relevant questions. This can help students better understand and retain complex medical concepts through active learning.

## How It Works

1. **Text Processing**: The modal RAG model processes text data to generate questions that target key concepts and details.
2. **Image Integration**: The multimodal RAG model combines text and image inputs to generate questions that address both visual and textual information.
3. **Question Generation**: The models use advanced natural language processing techniques to formulate questions that are educational and relevant.

## Applications

- **Medical Education**: Helps students prepare for exams by generating practice questions from their study materials.
- **Self-assessment**: Allows students to test their knowledge on specific topics.
- **Interactive Learning**: Enhances engagement by providing a mix of question types based on text and images.
